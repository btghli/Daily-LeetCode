### 81. Search in Rotated Sorted Array II

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.  

(i.e., `[0,0,1,2,2,5,6]` might become `[2,5,6,0,0,1,2]`).  

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return true, otherwise return `false`.  

###### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: true
```
###### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: false
```

###### Follow up:
- This is a follow up problem to Search in Rotated Sorted Array, where nums may contain duplicates.
- Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?
