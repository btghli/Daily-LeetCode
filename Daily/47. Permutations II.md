###### Medium / Backtracking

### 47. Permutations II

Given a collection of numbers, nums, that might contain duplicates, return all possible unique permutations in any order.

###### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output:
[[1,1,2],
 [1,2,1],
 [2,1,1]]
```

###### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: [[1,2,3],[1,3,2],[2,1,3],[2,3,1],[3,1,2],[3,2,1]]
```

###### Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 8`
- `-10 <= nums[i] <= 10`

#### Backtrakcing

Backtracking is a typical way to solve the permutation problems.  

I am gonna explain how Backtracing works for better understanding of how to avoid duplicates.  

Say `[1,2,3]` is given.  
First, we pick `1` and `visited[0]` is assigned to be `true`, the rest is `[2,3]`.  
Secondly, we pick `2` and `visited[1]` is assigned to be `true`, the rest is `[3]`.  
Finally, we pick `3`.
Then the length of `list` reachs `nums.length`, we can add this `list` to the final answer list.  
Then is the **backtracking**:  
We delete the `3` and assign the `visited[2]` is false and so on.  

The most import point here is:  
**After we pick one number, the rest of numbers is what we deal with next.**  

```
Example: we pick 2 first, and the rest is [1,3].  
```

#### To avoid the duplicate permutations:

Say `arr: [1,1,2]` is given:  
We pick `arr[0] = 1` first, and the rest is `[1,2]` and we keep doing the rest backtracking stuff.  
Afterwards, we back to pick the first element again.  
And if we pick `arr[1] = 1` this time, the rest will **also** be `[1,2]` which will cause a duplicate.  

#### And it is easy to resolve:

Based on the observation, we know `visited[i] = true` means we picked `i` in the previous round.  
And if we have this situation:   
`visited[i-1] = false` when we are about to pick `i`, which means `i-1` element has finished its backtracking round.  

```
Example: arr = [1,1,2]  
When we back to pick `arr[1] = 1` as the first element, we have already finished the `arr[0] = 1`, and `visited[0] = false` at this moment.  

So we encounter a duplicate number as `nums[i] == nums[i-1]`.
If `visited[i-1]` is `false`, we can simply skip this `i` round.
```


```java
class Solution {
    
    public void backtrack(int[] nums, boolean[] visited, List<Integer> temp, List<List<Integer>> ans){
        if(temp.size() == nums.length){
            ans.add(new LinkedList<>(temp));
            return;
        }
        
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++){
            if(i > 0 && nums[i] == nums[i-1] && !visited[i-1]) continue;
            
            if(!visited[i]){
                visited[i] = true;
                temp.add(nums[i]);
                
                backtrack(nums, visited, temp, ans);
                
                visited[i] = false;
                temp.remove(temp.size()-1);
            }
        }
        return;
    }
    
    public List<List<Integer>> permuteUnique(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        List<List<Integer>> ans = new LinkedList<>();
        backtrack(nums, new boolean[nums.length], new LinkedList<>(), ans);
        return ans;
    }
}
```
