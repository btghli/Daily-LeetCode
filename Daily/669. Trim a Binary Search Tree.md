### 669. Trim a Binary Search Tree

Given the root of a binary search tree and the lowest and highest boundaries as low and high, trim the tree so that all its elements lies in [low, high]. Trimming the tree should not change the relative structure of the elements that will remain in the tree (i.e., any node's descendant should remain a descendant). It can be proven that there is a unique answer.

Return the root of the trimmed binary search tree. Note that the root may change depending on the given bounds.

 

###### Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/09/trim1.jpg)
```
Input: root = [1,0,2], low = 1, high = 2
Output: [1,null,2]
```
###### Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/09/trim2.jpg)
```
Input: root = [3,0,4,null,2,null,null,1], low = 1, high = 3
Output: [3,2,null,1]
```
###### Example 3:
```
Input: root = [1], low = 1, high = 2
Output: [1]
```
###### Example 4:
```
Input: root = [1,null,2], low = 1, high = 3
Output: [1,null,2]
```
###### Example 5:
```
Input: root = [1,null,2], low = 2, high = 4
Output: [2]
```

###### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree in the range [1, 10<sup>4</sup>].
- 0 <= Node.val <= 10<sup>4</sup>
- The value of each node in the tree is unique.
- root is guaranteed to be a valid binary search tree.
- 0 <= low <= high <= 10<sup>4</sup>

***

Three situations in total:
1. low <= root.val <= high, in this situation the root doesn't need to change, so continue recursion on next level
2. root.val > high, means all the nodes to the left including the root doesn't fit the requirement, so we do recursion on right child node
3. root.val < low, same concept, we do recursion on left child node

```java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode trimBST(TreeNode root, int low, int high) {
        if (root == null) {
            return null;
        }
        if (root.val > high) {
            return trimBST(root.left, low, high);
        }
        if (root.val < low) {
            return trimBST(root.right, low, high);
        }
        root.left = trimBST(root.left, low, high);
        root.right = trimBST(root.right, low, high);
        return root;
    }
}
```
