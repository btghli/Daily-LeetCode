### 881. Boats to Save People

The i-th person has weight people[i], and each boat can carry a maximum weight of limit.

Each boat carries at most 2 people at the same time, provided the sum of the weight of those people is at most limit.

Return the minimum number of boats to carry every given person.  (It is guaranteed each person can be carried by a boat.)

 

###### Example 1:
```
Input: people = [1,2], limit = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 boat (1, 2)
```
###### Example 2:
```
Input: people = [3,2,2,1], limit = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 boats (1, 2), (2) and (3)
```
###### Example 3:
```
Input: people = [3,5,3,4], limit = 5
Output: 4
Explanation: 4 boats (3), (3), (4), (5)
```
###### Note:

* 1 <= people.length <= 50000
* 1 <= people[i] <= limit <= 30000

```java

        Arrays.sort(people);
        int res = 0;
        int start = 0;

#### Solution 2: Bucket Sort

###### Time: O(limit)
###### Space: O(limit)

```java
class Solution {
    public int numRescueBoats(int[] people, int limit) {
        int[] buckets = new int[limit + 1];
        for (int p : people) {
            buckets[p] ++;
        }
        int start = 0;
        int end = buckets.length - 1;
        int res = 0;
        
        while (start <= end) {
            // make sure start always point to a valid number
            while (start <= end && buckets[start] <= 0) {
                start ++;
            }
            // make sure end always point to a valid number
            while (start <= end && buckets[end] <= 0) {
                end --;
            }
            // if nobody left, break
            if (buckets[start] <= 0 && buckets[end] <= 0) {
                break;
            }
            res ++;
            // both start and end can be on the boat
            if (start + end <= limit) {
                buckets[start] --;
            }
            buckets[end] --;
