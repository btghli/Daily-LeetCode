### 1721. Swapping Nodes in a Linked List

You are given the head of a linked list, and an integer k.

Return the head of the linked list after swapping the values of the kth node from the beginning and the kth node from the end (the list is 1-indexed).

 

##### Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/21/linked1.jpg)
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [1,4,3,2,5]
```
##### Example 2:
```
Input: head = [7,9,6,6,7,8,3,0,9,5], k = 5
Output: [7,9,6,6,8,7,3,0,9,5]
```
##### Example 3:
```
Input: head = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]
```
##### Example 4:
```
Input: head = [1,2], k = 1
Output: [2,1]
```
##### Example 5:
```
Input: head = [1,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1,2,3]
``` 

##### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is n.
- 1 <= k <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup>
- 0 <= Node.val <= 100

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode swapNodes(ListNode head, int k) {
        ListNode first = head;
        ListNode second = head;
        ListNode fast = head;
        ListNode slow = head;
        
        // put fast k - 1 nodes after slow
        for (int i = 0; i < k - 1; i ++) {
            fast = fast.next;
        } 
        
        // we know that at this time fast is the first node we want
        first = fast;
        
        // keep the distance between fast and slow
        while (fast.next != null) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next;
        }
        
        // slow is the second node we want
        second = slow;
        
        int temp = first.val;
        first.val = second.val;
        second.val = temp;
        
        return head;
    }
}
```
