### 1354. Construct Target Array With Multiple Sums

Given an array of integers `target`. From a starting array, `A` consisting of all 1's, you may perform the following procedure :

- let `x` be the sum of all elements currently in your array.
- choose index `i`, such that `0 <= i < target.size` and set the value of `A` at index `i` to `x`.
- You may repeat this procedure as many times as needed.

Return True if it is possible to construct the `target` array from `A` otherwise return False.

 

##### Example 1:
```
Input: target = [9,3,5]
Output: true
Explanation: Start with [1, 1, 1] 
[1, 1, 1], sum = 3 choose index 1
[1, 3, 1], sum = 5 choose index 2
[1, 3, 5], sum = 9 choose index 0
[9, 3, 5] Done
```
##### Example 2:
```
Input: target = [1,1,1,2]
Output: false
Explanation: Impossible to create target array from [1,1,1,1].
```
##### Example 3:
```
Input: target = [8,5]
Output: true
``` 

##### Constraints:

- `N == target.length`
- `1 <= target.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `1 <= target[i] <= 10^9`

***

##### Time Complexity:
- O(nlogn) to build up the priority queue,
- O(logMax(target)logN) for the reducing value part.
- We have O(max(target)) loops

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPossible(int[] target) {
        /* The total sum always bigger than all elements.
        * We can decompose the biggest number.
        * Each round we get the current maximum value,
        * delete it by the sum of other elements.
        */
        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<Integer>((a, b) -> (b - a));
        long total = 0;
        for (int n : target) {
            total += n;
            pq.add(n);
        }
        while (true) {
            int n = pq.poll();
            total -= n;
            if (n == 1 || total == 1) {
                return true;
            }
            if (n < total || total == 0 || n % total == 0) {
                return false;
            }
            /* The % prevents the TLE from the case (e.g., target=[10000000, 1]) 
            * where the largest element is significantly bigger than the sum of 
            * other elements.
            */
            n %= total;
            total += n;
            pq.add(n);
        }
    }
}
```
