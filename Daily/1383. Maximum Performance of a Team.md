### 1383. Maximum Performance of a Team

You are given two integers `n` and `k` and two integer arrays `speed` and `efficiency` both of length `n`. There are `n` engineers numbered from `1` to `n`. `speed[i]` and `efficiency[i]` represent the speed and efficiency of the i<sup>th</sup> engineer respectively.

Choose **at most** `k` different engineers out of the `n` engineers to form a team with the maximum **performance**.

The performance of a team is the sum of their engineers' speeds multiplied by the minimum efficiency among their engineers.

Return _the maximum performance of this team_. Since the answer can be a huge number, return it **modulo** 10<sup>9</sup> + 7.

 

##### Example 1:
```
Input: n = 6, speed = [2,10,3,1,5,8], efficiency = [5,4,3,9,7,2], k = 2
Output: 60
Explanation: 
We have the maximum performance of the team by selecting engineer 2 (with speed=10 and efficiency=4) and engineer 5 (with speed=5 and efficiency=7). That is, performance = (10 + 5) * min(4, 7) = 60.
```
##### Example 2:
```
Input: n = 6, speed = [2,10,3,1,5,8], efficiency = [5,4,3,9,7,2], k = 3
Output: 68
Explanation:
This is the same example as the first but k = 3. We can select engineer 1, engineer 2 and engineer 5 to get the maximum performance of the team. That is, performance = (2 + 10 + 5) * min(5, 4, 7) = 68.
```
##### Example 3:
```
Input: n = 6, speed = [2,10,3,1,5,8], efficiency = [5,4,3,9,7,2], k = 4
Output: 72
``` 

##### Constraints:

- 1 <= <= k <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup>
- `speed.length == n`
- `efficiency.length == n`
- 1 <= speed[i] <= 10<sup>5</sup>
- 1 <= efficiency[i] <= 10<sup>8</sup>

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxPerformance(int n, int[] speed, int[] efficiency, int k) {
        int[][] table = new int[n][2];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i ++) {
            table[i] = new int[] {efficiency[i], speed[i]};
        }
        Arrays.sort(table, (a, b) -> b[0] - a[0]);
        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(k, (a, b) -> a - b);
        long res = 0;
        long sum = 0;
        for (int[] tuple : table) {
            pq.add(tuple[1]);
            sum += tuple[1];
            if (pq.size() > k) {
                sum -= pq.poll();
            }
            res = Math.max(res, (sum * tuple[0]));
        }
        return (int)(res % (long)(1e9 + 7));
    }
}
```
