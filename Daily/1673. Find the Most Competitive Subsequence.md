### 1673. Find the Most Competitive Subsequence

Given an integer array nums and a positive integer k, return the most competitive subsequence of nums of size k.

An array's subsequence is a resulting sequence obtained by erasing some (possibly zero) elements from the array.

We define that a subsequence a is more competitive than a subsequence b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ, subsequence a has a number less than the corresponding number in b. For example, [1,3,4] is more competitive than [1,3,5] because the first position they differ is at the final number, and 4 is less than 5.

 

###### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [3,5,2,6], k = 2
Output: [2,6]
Explanation: Among the set of every possible subsequence: {[3,5], [3,2], [3,6], [5,2], [5,6], [2,6]}, [2,6] is the most competitive.
```
###### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [2,4,3,3,5,4,9,6], k = 4
Output: [2,3,3,4]
```

###### Constraints:

* 1 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>
* 0 <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>9</sup>
* 1 <= k <= nums.length

##### Time Complexity: O(n)
##### Space Complexity: O(k)

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] mostCompetitive(int[] nums, int k) {
        Deque<Integer> stack = new ArrayDeque<>(); // stores the indexes of result numbers
        int[] res = new int[k];
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i ++) {
            /*
            * Checking:
            * 1. if stack is empty, then don't pop
            * 2. if current number is smaller than stack.peek(), pop and replace it after
            * 3. if there are enough numbers left in the array to make sure stack has k numbers
            */
            while (!stack.isEmpty() && nums[i] < nums[stack.peek()] && nums.length - i + stack.size() > k) {
                stack.pop();
            }
            if (stack.size() < k) {
                stack.push(i);
            }
        }
        for (int i = k - 1; i >= 0; i --) {
            res[i] = nums[stack.pop()];
        }
        return res;
    }
}
