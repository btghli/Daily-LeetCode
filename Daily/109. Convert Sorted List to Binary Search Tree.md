### 109. Convert Sorted List to Binary Search Tree

Given the `head` of a singly linked list where elements are **sorted in ascending order**, convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than `1`.

 

##### Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/17/linked.jpg)
```
Input: head = [-10,-3,0,5,9]
Output: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5]
Explanation: One possible answer is [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the shown height balanced BST.
```
##### Example 2:
```
Input: head = []
Output: []
```
##### Example 3:
```
Input: head = [0]
Output: [0]
```
##### Example 4:
```
Input: head = [1,3]
Output: [3,1]
``` 

##### Constraints: 

- The number of nodes in `head` is in the range [0, 2 * 10<sup>4</sup>].
- `-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5`

```java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode sortedListToBST(ListNode head) {
        return helper(head, null);
    }
    
    private TreeNode helper(ListNode head, ListNode tail) {
        if (head == tail) {
            return null;
        }
        ListNode slow = head;
        ListNode fast = head;
        while (fast != tail && fast.next != tail) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
        }
        TreeNode root = new TreeNode(slow.val);
        root.left = helper(head, slow);
        root.right = helper(slow.next, tail);
        return root;
    }
}
```
