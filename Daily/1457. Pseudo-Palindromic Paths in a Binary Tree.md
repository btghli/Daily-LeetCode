### 1457. Pseudo-Palindromic Paths in a Binary Tree

Given a binary tree where node values are digits from `1` to `9`.   
A path in the binary tree is said to be **pseudo-palindromic** if at least one permutation of the node values in the path is a palindrome.  

Return _the number of **pseudo-palindromic** paths going from the root node to leaf nodes._

###### Example 1:
```
Input: root = [2,3,1,3,1,null,1]
Output: 2 
Explanation: The figure above represents the given binary tree. There are three paths going from the root node to leaf nodes: the red path [2,3,3], the green path [2,1,1], and the path [2,3,1]. Among these paths only red path and green path are pseudo-palindromic paths since the red path [2,3,3] can be rearranged in [3,2,3] (palindrome) and the green path [2,1,1] can be rearranged in [1,2,1] (palindrome).
```

###### Example 2:
```
Input: root = [2,1,1,1,3,null,null,null,null,null,1]
Output: 1 
Explanation: The figure above represents the given binary tree. There are three paths going from the root node to leaf nodes: the green path [2,1,1], the path [2,1,3,1], and the path [2,1]. Among these paths only the green path is pseudo-palindromic since [2,1,1] can be rearranged in [1,2,1] (palindrome).
```

###### Example 3:
```
Input: root = [9]
Output: 1
```

###### Constraints:
- The given binary tree will have between `1` and `10^5` nodes.
- Node values are digits from `1` to `9`.
