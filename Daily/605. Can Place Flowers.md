### 605. Can Place Flowers

You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in **adjacent plots**.

Given an integer array `flowerbed` containing `0`'s and `1`'s, where `0` means empty and `1` means not empty, and an integer `n`,   
return _if `n` new flowers can be planted in the `flowerbed` without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule_.

###### Example 1:
```
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
Output: true
```

###### Example 2:
```
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
Output: false
```

###### Constraints:
- `1 <= flowerbed.length <= 2 * 104`
- `flowerbed[i]` is `0` or `1`.
- There are no two adjacent flowers in flowerbed.
- `0 <= n <= flowerbed.length`
