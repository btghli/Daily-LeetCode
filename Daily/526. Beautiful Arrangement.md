### 526. Beautiful Arrangement

Suppose you have n integers from 1 to n. We define a beautiful arrangement as an array that is constructed by these n numbers successfully if one of the following is true for the ith position (1 <= i <= n) in this array:

The number at the ith position is divisible by i.
i is divisible by the number at the ith position.
Given an integer n, return the number of the beautiful arrangements that you can construct.

 

###### Example 1:
```
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The first beautiful arrangement is [1, 2]:
Number at the 1st position (i=1) is 1, and 1 is divisible by i (i=1).
Number at the 2nd position (i=2) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=2).
The second beautiful arrangement is [2, 1]:
Number at the 1st position (i=1) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=1).
Number at the 2nd position (i=2) is 1, and i (i=2) is divisible by 1.
```
###### Example 2:
```
Input: n = 1
Output: 1
```
 

###### Constraints:

* 1 <= n <= 15

Time Complexity: O(N!) permutation

```java
class Solution {
    int res;
    public int countArrangement(int n) {
        res = 0;
        backtrack(new int[n + 1], n, 1);
        return res;
    }
    
    private void backtrack(int[] temp, int n, int index) {
        if (index > n) {
            res ++;
            return;
        }
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i ++) {
            if (temp[i] == 0 && (index % i == 0 || i % index == 0)) {
                temp[i] = 1;
                backtrack(temp, n, index + 1);
                temp[i] = 0;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Using Bitmask instead of visited array.

```java
class Solution {
    int res;
    
    public int countArrangement(int n) {
        res = 0;
        backtrack(0, n, 1);
        return res;
    }
    
    private void backtrack(int bm, int n, int index) {
        if (index > n) {
            res++;
            return;
        }
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i ++) {
            if ((bm&1<<i-1) == 0 && (index % i == 0 || i % index == 0)) {
                backtrack(bm^1<<i-1, n, index + 1);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

About `bm&1<<i-1`
```
The priority in this operation is:
First: i-1
Second: 1 << i-1
Third: bm & 1<<i-1
```
