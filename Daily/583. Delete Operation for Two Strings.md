### 583. Delete Operation for Two Strings

Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, return the _minimum number of **steps** required to make_ `word1` _and_ `word2` _the same_.

In one **step**, you can delete exactly one character in either string.

 

##### Example 1:
```
Input: word1 = "sea", word2 = "eat"
Output: 2
Explanation: You need one step to make "sea" to "ea" and another step to make "eat" to "ea".
```
##### Example 2:
```
Input: word1 = "leetcode", word2 = "etco"
Output: 4
``` 

##### Constraints:

- `1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 500`
- `word1` and `word2` consist of only lowercase English letters.

***

```java
class Solution {
    public int minDistance(String word1, String word2) {
        int[][] dp = new int[word1.length() + 1][word2.length() + 1]; // stores common character of both strings
        for (int i = 1; i <= word1.length(); i ++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= word2.length(); j ++) {
                dp[i][j] = (word1.charAt(i - 1) == word2.charAt(j - 1)) ? dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1 : Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }
        int val = dp[word1.length()][word2.length()];
        return word1.length() - val + word2.length() - val;
    }
}
```
