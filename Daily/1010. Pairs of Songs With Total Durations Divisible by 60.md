### 1010. Pairs of Songs With Total Durations Divisible by 60

You are given a list of songs where the ith song has a duration of time[i] seconds.

Return the number of pairs of songs for which their total duration in seconds is divisible by 60. Formally, we want the number of indices i, j such that i < j with (time[i] + time[j]) % 60 == 0.

 

###### Example 1:
```
Input: time = [30,20,150,100,40]
Output: 3
Explanation: Three pairs have a total duration divisible by 60:
(time[0] = 30, time[2] = 150): total duration 180
(time[1] = 20, time[3] = 100): total duration 120
(time[1] = 20, time[4] = 40): total duration 60
```
###### Example 2:
```
Input: time = [60,60,60]
Output: 3
Explanation: All three pairs have a total duration of 120, which is divisible by 60.
 ```

###### Constraints:

* 1 <= time.length <= 6 * 10^4
* 1 <= time[i] <= 500

***

Time Complexity: O(N)  
Space Complexity: O(N) for HashMap

```java
class Solution {
    public int numPairsDivisibleBy60(int[] time) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        int count = 0;
        for (int t : time) {
            t = t % 60;
            if (t == 0) {
                count += map.getOrDefault(t, 0);
            } else {
                count += map.getOrDefault(60 - t, 0);
            }
            map.put(t, map.getOrDefault(t, 0) + 1);
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
