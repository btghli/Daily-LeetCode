### 845. Longest Mountain in Array


Let's call any (contiguous) subarray B (of A) a mountain if the following properties hold:
- `B.length >= 3`
- There exists some `0 < i < B.length - 1` such that `B[0] < B[1] < ... B[i-1] < B[i] > B[i+1] > ... > B[B.length - 1]`

(Note that B could be any subarray of A, including the entire array A.). 

Given an array `A` of integers, return _the length of the longest mountain._.  

Return `0` if there is no mountain.  

###### Example 1:
```
Input: [2,1,4,7,3,2,5]
Output: 5
Explanation: The largest mountain is [1,4,7,3,2] which has length 5.
```

###### Example 2:
```
Input: [2,2,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no mountain.
```

###### Note:
- `0 <= A.length <= 10000`
- `0 <= A[i] <= 10000`

###### Follow up:
- Can you solve it using only one pass?
- Can you solve it in O(1) space?

        int max = 0, inc = 0, dec = 0;
        
        for(int i=1; i<A.length; i++){
            if(A[i] > A[i-1]){       // Current number greater than the previous
                if(dec > 0) inc = 0; // Reset inc if we had a decreasing sequence until the previous
				inc++;               // Increment inc
                dec = 0;             // Reset dec
            }
            else if(A[i] < A[i-1]){  // Current number smaller than the previous
                if(inc > 0){         // No need to do anything if we did not have an increasing sequence
                    dec++;           // Increment dec
                    max = Math.max(max, inc + dec + 1);  // Determine max for the current mountain
                }
            }
            else inc = dec = 0;      // Current number same as the previous, reset inc and dec
        }
        
        return max;
    }
}
