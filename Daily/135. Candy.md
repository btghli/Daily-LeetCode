### 135. Candy

There are `n` children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array `ratings`.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

- Each child must have at least one candy.
- Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

Return _the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children_.

 

##### Example 1:
```
Input: ratings = [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
```
##### Example 2:
```
Input: ratings = [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.
``` 

##### Constraints:

- `n == ratings.length`
- 1 <= n <= 2 * 10<sup>4</sup>
- 0 <= ratings[i] <= 2 * 10<sup>4</sup>

```java
class Solution {
    public int candy(int[] ratings) {
        int n = ratings.length;
        int[] res = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(res, 1);
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i ++) {
            if (ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]) {
                res[i] = res[i - 1] + 1;
            }
        }
        
        for (int i = n - 1; i > 0; i --) {
            if (ratings[i - 1] > ratings[i]) { 
                res[i - 1] = Math.max(res[i] + 1, res[i - 1]); // make sure you don't overwrite the result from the first pass
            }
        }
        
        int sum = 0;
        for (int num : res) {
            sum += num;
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```
