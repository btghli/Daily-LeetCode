### 1483. Kth Ancestor of a Tree Node

You are given a tree with `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n-1` in the form of a parent array where `parent[i]` is the parent of node `i`.   
The root of the tree is node `0`.

Implement the function `getKthAncestor(int node, int k)` to return the `k-th` ancestor of the given `node`. If there is no such ancestor, return `-1`.

The _k-th ancestor_ of a tree node is the `k-th` node in the path from that node to the root.  


###### Example:
```
Input:
["TreeAncestor","getKthAncestor","getKthAncestor","getKthAncestor"]
[[7,[-1,0,0,1,1,2,2]],[3,1],[5,2],[6,3]]

Output:
[null,1,0,-1]

Explanation:
TreeAncestor treeAncestor = new TreeAncestor(7, [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]);

treeAncestor.getKthAncestor(3, 1);  // returns 1 which is the parent of 3
treeAncestor.getKthAncestor(5, 2);  // returns 0 which is the grandparent of 5
treeAncestor.getKthAncestor(6, 3);  // returns -1 because there is no such ancestor
``` 

###### Constraints:

- `1 <= k <= n <= 5*10^4`
- `parent[0] == -1` indicating that `0` is the root node.
- 0 <= parent[i] < n` for all `0 < i < n`
- `0 <= node < n`
- There will be at most `5*10^4` queries.

***

Use only parent array is fine to the small amount queries.
Use 2D matrix to store all parents from 1 to n reduces the time but increases the space.
By using 1D array storing PriorityQueue which only stores the visited k-th parent reduces the space.

BUT
> There will be at most `5*10^4` queries.

The solution here is **Binary Lifting**
