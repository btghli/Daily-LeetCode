### 1143. Longest Common Subsequence

Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return _the length of their longest **common subsequence**_. If there is no **common subsequence**, return `0`.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

- For example, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"`.
A **common subsequence** of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

 

##### Example 1:
```
Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
```
##### Example 2:
```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
```
##### Example 3:
```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
``` 

##### Constraints:

- `1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000`
- `text1` and `text2` consist of only lowercase English characters.

```java
class Solution {
    public int longestCommonSubsequence(String s1, String s2) {
        int[][] dp = new int[s1.length() + 1][s2.length() + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i < s1.length(); ++i)
            for (int j = 0; j < s2.length(); ++j)
                if (s1.charAt(i) == s2.charAt(j)) dp[i + 1][j + 1] = 1 + dp[i][j];
                else dp[i + 1][j + 1] =  Math.max(dp[i][j + 1], dp[i + 1][j]);
        return dp[s1.length()][s2.length()];
    }
}
