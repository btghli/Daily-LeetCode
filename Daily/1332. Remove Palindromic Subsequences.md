### 1332. Remove Palindromic Subsequences

Given a string s consisting only of letters 'a' and 'b'. In a single step you can remove one palindromic subsequence from s.

Return the minimum number of steps to make the given string empty.

A string is a subsequence of a given string, if it is generated by deleting some characters of a given string without changing its order.

A string is called palindrome if is one that reads the same backward as well as forward.

 

##### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "ababa"
Output: 1
Explanation: String is already palindrome
```
##### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "abb"
Output: 2
Explanation: "abb" -> "bb" -> "". 
Remove palindromic subsequence "a" then "bb".
```
##### Example 3:
```
Input: s = "baabb"
Output: 2
Explanation: "baabb" -> "b" -> "". 
Remove palindromic subsequence "baab" then "b".
```
##### Example 4:
```
Input: s = ""
Output: 0
```

##### Constraints:

- 0 <= s.length <= 1000
- s only consists of letters 'a' and 'b'

***

```java
class Solution {
    public int removePalindromeSub(String s) {
        /*
        * The string is only consisting with letter 'a' and 'b'
        * if string is a palindrome, return 1
        * else we just need to remove all 'a's and all 'b's, and it takes 2 steps
        */
        return s.isEmpty() ? 0 : (s.equals(new StringBuilder(s).reverse().toString()) ? 1:2);
    }
}
```
