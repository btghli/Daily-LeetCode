### 1015. Smallest Integer Divisible by K

Given a positive integer K, you need to find the length of the smallest positive integer N such that N is divisible by K, and N only contains the digit 1.  

Return the length of N. If there is no such N, return -1.  

Note: N may not fit in a 64-bit signed integer.  
 
###### Example 1:
```
Input: K = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: The smallest answer is N = 1, which has length 1.
```

###### Example 2:
```
Input: K = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no such positive integer N divisible by 2.
```

###### Example 3:
```
Input: K = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The smallest answer is N = 111, which has length 3.
``` 

###### Constraints:

- 1 <= K <= 105

```java
class Solution { 
    public int smallestRepunitDivByK(int K) {
        if(K % 2 == 0 || K % 5 == 0)
            return -1;
            
        // Since the remainder and N have the same remainder of K, it OK to use remainder instead of N.
        int remainder = 1;
        int len = 1;
        
        while(N % K != 0) {
            remainder = (remainder * 10 + 1) % K;
            len++;
        }
        
        return len;
    }
}
```

If `N` doesn't exist, the following code will go endlessly.  
Also, obviously if a pattern go endlessly, some `number` will repeat itself. So, we can have a `HashSet` to check duplicate.  

Or, with more insight in this pattern, we can figuare out that the `remainder` could be repeated and it ranges from `0` to `K-1`.

So, if the loop goes K times and does not end. It's safe to return `-1`.

```
class Solution {
    public int smallestRepunitDivByK(int K) {
        int remainder = 0;
        for (int length_N = 1; length_N <= K; length_N++) {
            remainder = (remainder * 10 + 1) % K;
            if (remainder == 0) {
                return length_N;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```
