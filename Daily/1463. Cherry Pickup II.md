### 1463. Cherry Pickup II

Given a `rows x cols` matrix `grid` representing a field of cherries. Each cell in `grid` represents the number of cherries that you can collect.  

You have two robots that can collect cherries for you, Robot #1 is located at the top-left corner (0,0) , and Robot #2 is located at the top-right corner (0, cols-1) of the grid.  
 
Return _the maximum number of cherries collection using both robots by following the rules below:_

- From a cell (i,j), robots can move to cell (i+1, j-1) , (i+1, j) or (i+1, j+1).
- When any robot is passing through a cell, It picks it up all cherries, and the cell becomes an empty cell (0).
- When both robots stay on the same cell, only one of them takes the cherries.
- Both robots cannot move outside of the grid at any moment.
- Both robots should reach the bottom row in the grid.
 

###### Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/04/29/sample_1_1802.png)
```
Input: grid = [[3,1,1],[2,5,1],[1,5,5],[2,1,1]]
Output: 24
Explanation: Path of robot #1 and #2 are described in color green and blue respectively.
Cherries taken by Robot #1, (3 + 2 + 5 + 2) = 12.
Cherries taken by Robot #2, (1 + 5 + 5 + 1) = 12.
Total of cherries: 12 + 12 = 24.
```

###### Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/04/23/sample_2_1802.png)
```
Input: grid = [[1,0,0,0,0,0,1],[2,0,0,0,0,3,0],[2,0,9,0,0,0,0],[0,3,0,5,4,0,0],[1,0,2,3,0,0,6]]
Output: 28
Explanation: Path of robot #1 and #2 are described in color green and blue respectively.
Cherries taken by Robot #1, (1 + 9 + 5 + 2) = 17.
Cherries taken by Robot #2, (1 + 3 + 4 + 3) = 11.
Total of cherries: 17 + 11 = 28.
```

###### Example 3:
```
Input: grid = [[1,0,0,3],[0,0,0,3],[0,0,3,3],[9,0,3,3]]
Output: 22
```

###### Example 4:
```
Input: grid = [[1,1],[1,1]]
Output: 4
```

###### Constraints:
- rows == grid.length
- cols == grid[i].length
- 2 <= rows, cols <= 70
- 0 <= grid[i][j] <= 100
