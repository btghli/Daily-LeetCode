### 820. Short Encoding of Words

A valid encoding of an array of words is any reference string s and array of indices indices such that:

words.length == indices.length
The reference string s ends with the '#' character.
For each index indices[i], the substring of s starting from indices[i] and up to (but not including) the next '#' character is equal to words[i].
Given an array of words, return the length of the shortest reference string s possible of any valid encoding of words.

 

###### Example 1:
```
Input: words = ["time", "me", "bell"]
Output: 10
Explanation: A valid encoding would be s = "time#bell#" and indices = [0, 2, 5].
words[0] = "time", the substring of s starting from indices[0] = 0 to the next '#' is underlined in "time#bell#"
words[1] = "me", the substring of s starting from indices[1] = 2 to the next '#' is underlined in "time#bell#"
words[2] = "bell", the substring of s starting from indices[2] = 5 to the next '#' is underlined in "time#bell#"
```
###### Example 2:
```
Input: words = ["t"]
Output: 2
Explanation: A valid encoding would be s = "t#" and indices = [0].
```
 

###### Constraints:

- 1 <= words.length <= 2000
- 1 <= words[i].length <= 7
- words[i] consists of only lowercase letters.

##### Trie

```java
class Solution {
    
    class Node{
        Node[] children;
        public Node(){
            children = new Node[26];
        }
    }
    
    class Trie{
        Node root;
        public Trie(){
            root = new Node();
        }
        
        public boolean add(String word){
            char[] ch = word.toCharArray();
            Node node = root;
            boolean created = false;
            for(int i = ch.length-1; i >= 0; i--){
                char c = ch[i];
                if(node.children[c-'a'] == null){
                    node.children[c-'a'] = new Node();
                    created = true;
                }
                node = node.children[c-'a'];
                
            }
            return created;
        }
    }
    
    public int minimumLengthEncoding(String[] words) {
        Arrays.sort(words, (a, b) -> b.length() - a.length());
        Trie trie = new Trie();
        int count = 0;
        for(String word : words){
            if(trie.add(word)){
                count += word.length() + 1;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
