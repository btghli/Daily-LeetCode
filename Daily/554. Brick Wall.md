### 554. Brick Wall

There is a brick wall in front of you. The wall is rectangular and has several rows of bricks. The bricks have the same height but different width. You want to draw a vertical line from the **top** to the **bottom** and cross the **least** bricks.

The brick wall is represented by a list of rows. Each row is a list of integers representing the width of each brick in this row from left to right.

If your line go through the edge of a brick, then the brick is not considered as crossed. You need to find out how to draw the line to cross the least bricks and return the number of crossed bricks.

**You cannot draw a line just along one of the two vertical edges of the wall, in which case the line will obviously cross no bricks.**

 

##### Example:
```
Input: [[1,2,2,1],
        [3,1,2],
        [1,3,2],
        [2,4],
        [3,1,2],
        [1,3,1,1]]

Output: 2
```

##### Note:

- The width sum of bricks in different rows are the same and won't exceed INT_MAX.
- The number of bricks in each row is in range [1,10,000]. The height of wall is in range [1,10,000]. Total number of bricks of the wall won't exceed 20,000.

```java
class Solution {
    public int leastBricks(List<List<Integer>> wall) {
        if (wall == null || wall.size() == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        int cur = 0;
        for (List<Integer> row : wall) {
            cur = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < row.size() - 1; i ++) {
                cur += row.get(i);
                map.put(cur, map.getOrDefault(cur, 0) + 1);
            }
        }
        int res = 0;
        for (int key : map.keySet()) {
            res = Math.max(res, map.get(key));
        }
        return wall.size() - res;
    }
}
```
