### 1047. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates In String

Given a string `s` of lowercase letters, a **duplicate removal** consists of choosing two **adjacent** and **equal** letters, and removing them.

We repeatedly make **duplicate removals** on `s` until we no longer can.

Return _the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made_.  It is guaranteed the answer is **unique**.

 

##### Example 1:
```
Input: "abbaca"
Output: "ca"
Explanation: 
For example, in "abbaca" we could remove "bb" since the letters are adjacent and equal, and this is the only possible move.  
The result of this move is that the string is "aaca", of which only "aa" is possible, so the final string is "ca".
``` 

##### Note:

- `1 <= S.length <= 20000`
- `s` consists only of English lowercase letters.

##### StringBuilder as Stack

```java
class Solution {
    public String removeDuplicates(String S) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (char c : S.toCharArray()) {
            int size = sb.length();
            if (size > 0 && sb.charAt(size - 1) == c) {
                sb.deleteCharAt(size - 1);
            } else {
                sb.append(c);
            }
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```

##### Two Pointers

```java
class Solution {
    public String removeDuplicates(String S) {
        // index to set next character in the output string
        int i = 0;
        int n = S.length();
        char[] res = S.toCharArray();
        // j refers to the index of current iteration in teh input string
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j ++) {
            /*
            * If S[j] is same as the current last character S[i - 1],
            * we remove duplicates by doing i -= 2.
            *
            * If S[j] is different as the current last character S[i - 1],
            * we set S[i] = S[j] and increment i++.
            */
            res[i] = res[j];
            if (i > 0 && res[i - 1] == res[i]) {
                i -= 2;
            }
            i ++;
        }
        return new String(res, 0, i);
    }
}
```
