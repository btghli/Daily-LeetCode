### 452. Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons

There are some spherical balloons spread in two-dimensional space. For each balloon, provided input is the start and end coordinates of the horizontal diameter. 
Since it's horizontal, y-coordinates don't matter, and hence the x-coordinates of start and end of the diameter suffice. The start is always smaller than the end.
An arrow can be shot up exactly vertically from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with xstart and xend bursts by an arrow shot at x if xstart ≤ x ≤ xend. 
There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. An arrow once shot keeps traveling up infinitely.

Given an array points where points[i] = [xstart, xend], return the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.

 

##### Example 1:
```
Input: points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]
Output: 2
Explanation: One way is to shoot one arrow for example at x = 6 (bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6]) and another arrow at x = 11 (bursting the other two balloons).
```

##### Example 2:
```
Input: points = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]
Output: 4
```

##### Example 3:
```
Input: points = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]]
Output: 2
```

##### Example 4:
```
Input: points = [[1,2]]
Output: 1
```

##### Example 5:
```
Input: points = [[2,3],[2,3]]
Output: 1
```

##### Constraints:

* 0 <= points.length <= 10^4
* points.length == 2
* -2^31 <= xstart < xend <= 2^31 - 1

        int res = 0;
        // sort the balloons by its starting position
        Arrays.sort(points, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0])); // Using Integer.compare instead of a[0] - b[0] to prevent overflow
        int minEnd = Integer.MAX_VALUE; // keep tracks of the ending point of the current activating overlapping interval
        for (int[] point : points) {
            // if the starting point of current interval is larger than the end point, start a new activating interval
            if (point[0] > minEnd) {
                res ++;
                minEnd = point[1];
            } else {
                minEnd = Math.min(minEnd, point[1]);
            }
        }
        return res + 1;
    }
