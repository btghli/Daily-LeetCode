### 563. Binary Tree Tilt

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the sum of every tree node's tilt_.  

The **tilt** of a tree node is the **absolute difference** between the sum of all left subtree node **values** and all right subtree node **values**.   
If a node does not have a left child, then the sum of the left subtree node **values** is treated as `0`. The rule is similar if there the node does not have a right child.


###### Example 1:
```
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
Tilt of node 2 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
Tilt of node 3 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
Tile of node 1 : |2-3| = 1 (left subtree is just left child, so sum is 2; right subtree is just right child, so sum is 3)
Sum of every tilt : 0 + 0 + 1 = 1
```

###### Example 2:
```
Input: root = [4,2,9,3,5,null,7]
Output: 15
Explanation: 
Tilt of node 3 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
Tilt of node 5 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
Tilt of node 7 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
Tilt of node 2 : |3-5| = 2 (left subtree is just left child, so sum is 3; right subtree is just right child, so sum is 5)
Tilt of node 9 : |0-7| = 7 (no left child, so sum is 0; right subtree is just right child, so sum is 7)
Tilt of node 4 : |(3+5+2)-(9+7)| = |10-16| = 6 (left subtree values are 3, 5, and 2, which sums to 10; right subtree values are 9 and 7, which sums to 16)
Sum of every tilt : 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 7 + 6 = 15
```

###### Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 104]`.
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

```python
class Solution:
    def findTilt(self, root):
        def dfs(node):
            if not node: return [0,0]
            t1, s1 = dfs(node.left)
            t2, s2 = dfs(node.right)
            return [t1+t2+abs(s1-s2), s1+s2+node.val]
        return dfs(root)[0]
```
