### 222. Count Complete Tree Nodes

Given the root of a **complete** binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the tree.

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Types_of_binary_trees), every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled in a complete binary tree, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2<sup>h</sup> nodes inclusive at the last level `h`.

Design an algorithm that runs in less than `O(n)` time complexity.

 

##### Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/14/complete.jpg)
```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: 6
```
##### Example 2:
```
Input: root = []
Output: 0
```
##### Example 3:
```
Input: root = [1]
Output: 1
``` 

##### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5 * 10<sup>4</sup>].
- 0 <= Node.val <= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup>
- The tree is guaranteed to be **complete**.

```java
class Solution {
    public int countNodes(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return 0;
        //如果为perfect binary tree可以直接求出结果不需要进入recursion
        int h1 = 0, h2 = 0;
        TreeNode left = root;
        TreeNode right = root;
        while (left != null) {
            h1 ++;
            left = left.left;
        }
        while (right != null) {
            h2 ++;
            right = right.right;
        }
        if (h1 == h2) {
            //位运算，1 << h1 等价于 2^{h1}, 记得加上括号，因为 << 运算的优先级比加减还要低。
            return (1 << h1) - 1;
        } else {
            //普通二叉数求node数量
            return countNodes(root.left) + countNodes(root.right) + 1;
        }
    }
}
```
