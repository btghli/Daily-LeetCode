### 953. Verifying and Alien Dictionary

In an alien language, surprisingly they also use english lowercase letters, but possibly in a different order. The order of the alphabet is some permutation of lowercase letters.

Given a sequence of words written in the alien language, and the order of the alphabet, return true if and only if the given words are sorted lexicographicaly in this alien language.

 

##### Example 1:
```
Input: words = ["hello","leetcode"], order = "hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: true
Explanation: As 'h' comes before 'l' in this language, then the sequence is sorted.
```
##### Example 2:
```
Input: words = ["word","world","row"], order = "worldabcefghijkmnpqstuvxyz"
Output: false
Explanation: As 'd' comes after 'l' in this language, then words[0] > words[1], hence the sequence is unsorted.
```
##### Example 3:
```
Input: words = ["apple","app"], order = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: false
Explanation: The first three characters "app" match, and the second string is shorter (in size.) According to lexicographical rules "apple" > "app", because 'l' > '∅', where '∅' is defined as the blank character which is less than any other character (More info).
```

##### Constraints:

- `1 <= words.length <= 100`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 20`
- `order.length == 26`
- All characters in `words[i]` and `order` are English lowercase letters.

***

```java
class Solution {
    int[] table = new int[26];
    
    public boolean isAlienSorted(String[] words, String order) {
        for (int i = 0; i < order.length(); i++) {
            table[order.charAt(i) - 'a'] = i;
        }
        for (int i = 1; i < words.length; i ++) {
            if (bigger(words[i - 1], words[i])) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
    
    private boolean bigger(String s1, String s2) {
        int n = s1.length();
        int m = s2.length();
        for (int i = 0; i < n && i < m; i ++) {
            if (s1.charAt(i) != s2.charAt(i)) {
                return table[s1.charAt(i) - 'a'] > table[s2.charAt(i) - 'a'];
            }
        }
        return n > m;
    }
}
```
