### 1710. Maxiumum Units on a Truck

You are assigned to put some amount of boxes onto **one truck**. You are given a 2D array `boxTypes`, where `boxTypes[i] = [numberOfBoxesi, numberOfUnitsPerBoxi]`:

- numberOfBoxes<sub>i</sub> is the number of boxes of type `i`.
- numberOfUnitsPerBox<sub>i</sub> is the number of units in each box of the type `i`.

You are also given an integer `truckSize`, which is the **maximum** number of **boxes** that can be put on the truck. You can choose any boxes to put on the truck as long as the number of boxes does not exceed `truckSize`.

Return _the **maximum** total number of **units** that can be put on the truck_.

 

##### Example 1:
```
Input: boxTypes = [[1,3],[2,2],[3,1]], truckSize = 4
Output: 8
Explanation: There are:
- 1 box of the first type that contains 3 units.
- 2 boxes of the second type that contain 2 units each.
- 3 boxes of the third type that contain 1 unit each.
You can take all the boxes of the first and second types, and one box of the third type.
The total number of units will be = (1 * 3) + (2 * 2) + (1 * 1) = 8.
```
##### Example 2:
```
Input: boxTypes = [[5,10],[2,5],[4,7],[3,9]], truckSize = 10
Output: 91
``` 

##### Constraints:

- `1 <= boxTypes.length <= 1000`
- 1 <= numberOfBoxes<sub>i</sub>, numberOfUnitsPerBox<sub>i</sub> <= 1000
- 1 <= truckSize <= 10<sup>6</sup>

```java
class Solution {
    public int maximumUnits(int[][] boxTypes, int truckSize) {
        int[] units = new int[1001];
        for (int[] box : boxTypes) {
            units[box[1]] += box[0];
        }
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = units.length - 1; i >= 0; i --) {
            if (units[i] == 0) {
                continue;
            }
            int unitNum = Math.min(units[i], truckSize);
            res += unitNum * i;
            truckSize -= unitNum;
            if (truckSize == 0) {
                return res;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
