### 1626. Best Team With No Conflicts

ou are the manager of a basketball team. For the upcoming tournament, you want to choose the team with the highest overall score.   
The score of the team is the sum of scores of all the players in the team.

However, the basketball team is not allowed to have **conflicts.**   
A conflict exists if a younger player has a **strictly higher** score than an older player.   
A conflict does **not** occur between players of the same age.

Given two lists, `scores` and `ages`, where each `scores[i]` and `ages[i]` represents the score and age of the `ith` player,   
respectively, return the _highest overall score of all possible basketball teams._


###### Example 1:
```
Input: scores = [1,3,5,10,15], ages = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 34
Explanation: You can choose all the players.
```

###### Example 2:
```
Input: scores = [4,5,6,5], ages = [2,1,2,1]
Output: 16
Explanation: It is best to choose the last 3 players. Notice that you are allowed to choose multiple people of the same age.
```

###### Example 3:
```
Input: scores = [1,2,3,5], ages = [8,9,10,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: It is best to choose the first 3 players. 
```

###### Constraints:
- 1 <= scores.length, ages.length <= 1000
- scores.length == ages.length
- 1 <= scores[i] <= 106
- 1 <= ages[i] <= 1000

           candidate[i][1] = scores[i];
       }
       
       // sort with ascending ages and ascending scores when same ages
       Arrays.sort(candidate, (a,b) -> a[0] == b[0] ? a[1]-b[1] : a[0]-b[0]);

           for(int j=0; j<i; j++) {           
               // player j must younger than i
               // need to check younger player has lower score
               if(candidate[j][1] <= candidate[i][1]) { 
                   dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i], candidate[i][1]+dp[j]);
               }  
           }
           max = Math.max(dp[i], max);
       }
       return max;
   }
}
