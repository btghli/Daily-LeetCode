### 890. Find and Replace Pattern

You have a list of `words` and a `pattern`, and you want to know which words in `words` matches the pattern.  

A word matches the pattern if there exists a permutation of letters `p` so that after replacing every letter `x` in the pattern with `p(x)`, we get the desired word.  

_(Recall that a permutation of letters is a bijection from letters to letters: every letter maps to another letter, and no two letters map to the same letter.)_. 

Return a list of the words in `words` that match the given pattern.   

You may return the answer in any order.  

###### Example 1:
```
Input: words = ["abc","deq","mee","aqq","dkd","ccc"], pattern = "abb"
Output: ["mee","aqq"]
Explanation: "mee" matches the pattern because there is a permutation {a -> m, b -> e, ...}. 
"ccc" does not match the pattern because {a -> c, b -> c, ...} is not a permutation,
since a and b map to the same letter.
```

###### Note:
- `1 <= words.length <= 50`
- `1 <= pattern.length = words[i].length <= 20`

            int[] w2p = new int[26], p2w = new int[26];
            Arrays.fill(w2p, -1);
