### 968. Binary Tree Cameras

Given a binary tree, we install cameras on the nodes of the tree. 

Each camera at a node can monitor **its parent, itself, and its immediate children**.

Calculate the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the tree.

 

##### Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/29/bst_cameras_01.png)
```
Input: [0,0,null,0,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: One camera is enough to monitor all nodes if placed as shown.
```
##### Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/29/bst_cameras_02.png)
```
Input: [0,0,null,0,null,0,null,null,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: At least two cameras are needed to monitor all nodes of the tree. The above image shows
one of the valid configurations of camera placement.
```
##### Note:

- The number of nodes in the given tree will be in the range `[1, 1000]`.
- **Every** node has value 0.

    * if it has a child which is the parent of a leaf(code 1), then it is covered
