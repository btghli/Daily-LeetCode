### 115. Distinct Subsequence

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return _the number of distinct subsequences of `s` which equals `t`_.

A string's **subsequence** is a new string formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the remaining characters' relative positions. (i.e., `"ACE"` is a subsequence of `"ABCDE"` while `"AEC"` is not).

It is guaranteed the answer fits on a 32-bit signed integer.

 

##### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "rabbbit", t = "rabbit"
Output: 3
Explanation:
As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate "rabbit" from S.
rabbbit
rabbbit
rabbbit
```
##### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "babgbag", t = "bag"
Output: 5
Explanation:
As shown below, there are 5 ways you can generate "bag" from S.
babgbag
babgbag
babgbag
babgbag
babgbag
``` 

##### Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 1000`
- `s` and `t` consist of English letters.

```java
class Solution {
    public int numDistinct(String S, String T) {
        // array creation
        int[][] mem = new int[T.length()+1][S.length()+1];

        // filling the first row: with 1s
        for(int j=0; j<=S.length(); j++) {
            mem[0][j] = 1;
        }

        // the first column is 0 by default in every other rows but the first, which we need.

        for(int i=0; i<T.length(); i++) {
            for(int j=0; j<S.length(); j++) {
                if(T.charAt(i) == S.charAt(j)) {
                    mem[i+1][j+1] = mem[i][j] + mem[i+1][j];
                } else {
                    mem[i+1][j+1] = mem[i+1][j];
                }
            }
        }

        return mem[T.length()][S.length()];
    }
}
```
