### 991. Broken Calculator

On a broken calculator that has a number showing on its display, we can perform two operations:

Double: Multiply the number on the display by 2, or;
Decrement: Subtract 1 from the number on the display.
Initially, the calculator is displaying the number X.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to display the number Y.

 

###### Example 1:
```
Input: X = 2, Y = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: Use double operation and then decrement operation {2 -> 4 -> 3}.
```
###### Example 2:
```
Input: X = 5, Y = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: Use decrement and then double {5 -> 4 -> 8}.
```
###### Example 3:
```
Input: X = 3, Y = 10
Output: 3
Explanation:  Use double, decrement and double {3 -> 6 -> 5 -> 10}.
```
###### Example 4:
```
Input: X = 1024, Y = 1
Output: 1023
Explanation: Use decrement operations 1023 times.
```

###### Note:

- 1 <= X <= 10^9
- 1 <= Y <= 10^9

##### Greedy
##### Time Complexity: O(log(Y/X))

##### From Y to X

```java
class Solution {
    public int brokenCalc(int X, int Y) {
        int res = 0;
        /*
        * do Y / 2 all the way until it's smaller than X
        * if Y is even, Y = Y / 2
        * if Y is odd, Y = (Y + 1) / 2
        * we will never do Y + 1 twice in a row because we will always end with Y / 2
        * because (Y + 1 + 1) / 2 = (Y / 2) + 1, 3 operations are more than 2
        * we always choose Y / 2 if Y is even
        */
        while (Y > X) {
            if (Y % 2 != 0) {
                Y = Y + 1;
            } else {
                Y = Y / 2;
            }
            res ++;
        }
        // + X - Y is because when Y is smaller or equal to X, the only option we can do is keep + 1
        return res + X - Y;
    }
}
```
