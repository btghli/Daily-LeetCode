### 1026. Maximum Difference Between Node and Ancestor

Given the root of a binary tree, find the maximum value V for which there exist different nodes A and B where V = |A.val - B.val| and A is an ancestor of B.  

A node A is an ancestor of B if either: any child of A is equal to B, or any child of A is an ancestor of B.  

###### Example 1:
```
Input: root = [8,3,10,1,6,null,14,null,null,4,7,13]
Output: 7
Explanation: We have various ancestor-node differences, some of which are given below :
|8 - 3| = 5
|3 - 7| = 4
|8 - 1| = 7
|10 - 13| = 3
Among all possible differences, the maximum value of 7 is obtained by |8 - 1| = 7.
```

###### Example 2:
```
Input: root = [1,null,2,null,0,3]
Output: 3
```

###### Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 5000].
- `0 <= Node.val <= 105`

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

import sys

class Solution:
    def maxAncestorDiff(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        def dfs(root):
            if(root == None): return [sys.maxsize, 0, 0]
            min_left, max_left, max_diff_left = dfs(root.left)
            min_right, max_right, max_diff_right = dfs(root.right)
            min_soFar = min(min_left, min_right, root.val)
            max_soFar = max(max_left, max_right, root.val)
            return [min_soFar, max_soFar, max(max_diff_left, max_diff_right, max_soFar-root.val, root.val-min_soFar)]
        return dfs(root)[2]
            
        
```
