### 1339. Maximum Product of Split Binary Tree

Given the `root` of a binary tree, split the binary tree into two subtrees by removing one edge such that the product of the sums of the subtrees is maximized.

Return _the maximum product of the sums of the two subtrees_. Since the answer may be too large, return it **modulo** 10<sup>9</sup> + 7.

**Note** that you need to maximize the answer before taking the mod and not after taking it.

 

##### Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/21/sample_1_1699.png)
```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: 110
Explanation: Remove the red edge and get 2 binary trees with sum 11 and 10. Their product is 110 (11*10)
```
##### Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/21/sample_2_1699.png)
```
Input: root = [1,null,2,3,4,null,null,5,6]
Output: 90
Explanation: Remove the red edge and get 2 binary trees with sum 15 and 6.Their product is 90 (15*6)
```
##### Example 3:
```
Input: root = [2,3,9,10,7,8,6,5,4,11,1]
Output: 1025
```
##### Example 4:
```
Input: root = [1,1]
Output: 1
``` 

##### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 5 * 10<sup>4</sup>].
- 1 <= Node.val <= 10<sup>4</sup>

***

##### Time Complexity: O(n)
##### Space Complexity: O(height)
