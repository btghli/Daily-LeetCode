### 240. Search a 2D Matrix II

Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix. This matrix has the following properties:  

- Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
- Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.

###### Example:

Consider the following matrix:
```
[
  [1,   4,  7, 11, 15],
  [2,   5,  8, 12, 19],
  [3,   6,  9, 16, 22],
  [10, 13, 14, 17, 24],
  [18, 21, 23, 26, 30]
]

Given target = 5, return true.
Given target = 20, return false.
```

***

For this specific sorted matrix, the most efficient way of searching is  
to search from the left upper corner.

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean searchMatrix(int[][] matrix, int target) {
        if(matrix.length == 0 || matrix[0].length == 0) return false;
        int rowLen = matrix.length, colLen = matrix[0].length;
        int x = 0, y = colLen-1;
        while(x < rowLen && y >= 0){
            if(matrix[x][y] == target){
            return true;
            }
            else if(matrix[x][y] > target){
                y -= 1;
            }
            else 
                x += 1;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```
