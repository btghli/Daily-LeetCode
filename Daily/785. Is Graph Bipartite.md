### 785. Is Graph Bipartite

There is an undirected graph with n nodes, where each node is numbered between 0 and n - 1. You are given a 2D array graph, where graph[u] is an array of nodes that node u is adjacent to. More formally, for each v in graph[u], there is an undirected edge between node u and node v. The graph has the following properties:

There are no self-edges (graph[u] does not contain u).
There are no parallel edges (graph[u] does not contain duplicate values).
If v is in graph[u], then u is in graph[v] (the graph is undirected).
The graph may not be connected, meaning there may be two nodes u and v such that there is no path between them.
A graph is bipartite if the nodes can be partitioned into two independent sets A and B such that every edge in the graph connects a node in set A and a node in set B.

Return true if and only if it is bipartite.

 

###### Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/21/bi2.jpg)
```
Input: graph = [[1,2,3],[0,2],[0,1,3],[0,2]]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no way to partition the nodes into two independent sets such that every edge connects a node in one and a node in the other.
```
###### Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/21/bi1.jpg)
```
Input: graph = [[1,3],[0,2],[1,3],[0,2]]
Output: true
Explanation: We can partition the nodes into two sets: {0, 2} and {1, 3}.
```

###### Constraints:

- graph.length == n
- 1 <= n <= 100
- 0 <= graph[u].length < n
- 0 <= graph[u][i] <= n - 1
- graph[u] does not contain u.
- All the values of graph[u] are unique.
- If graph[u] contains v, then graph[v] contains u.

###### DFS

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isBipartite(int[][] graph) {
        int[] colors = new int[graph.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < graph.length; i ++) {
            if (colors[i] == 0 && !dfs(graph, colors, i, 1)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
    
    private boolean dfs(int[][] graph, int[] colors, int node, int curColor) {
        if (colors[node] != 0) {
            return colors[node] == curColor;
        }
        colors[node] = curColor;
        for (int next : graph[node]) {
            if (!dfs(graph, colors, next, -curColor)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

###### BFS

```java
