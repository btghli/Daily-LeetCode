###### Hard / Dynamic Programming

### 72. Edit Distance

Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, return _the minimum number of operations required to convert `word1` to `word2`_.

You have the following three operations permitted on a word:
- Insert a character
- Delete a character
- Replace a character
 

###### Example 1:
```
Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
Output: 3
Explanation: 
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')
```

###### Example 2:
```
Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
Output: 5
Explanation: 
intention -> inention (remove 't')
inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
exection -> execution (insert 'u')
``` 

###### Constraints:
- `0 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 500`
- `word1` and `word2` consist of lowercase English letters.

#### Dynamic Programming

If we have known the distance between `w1` and `w2` with length `i` and `j` is `m`.  

We can mark `[i,j] = m`.  

Naturally, we know 
- the distance of `w1+a` and `w2+a` is `m`. Mark this as `[i+1, j+1] = m`;
- the distance of `w1+a` and `w2` is `m+1`. Mark this as `[i+1, j] = m+1`;
- the distance of `w1` and `w2+a` is `m+1`. Mark this as `[i, j+1] = m+1`;

Conversely, if we wanna know the distance between `word1` and `word2` with length `i` and `j`, we can look at the last character first:

if `word1.charAt(i-1) == word2.charAt(j-1)`  
- `[i,j]` would be equal to `[i-1, j-1]`;

else if `word1.charAt(i-1) != word2.charAt(j-1)`,  
`[i,j]` would be the `1` plus the minimum number among the following possibilities:
- `[i-1,j]` (delete `word1.charAt(i-1)`) or 
- `[i,j-1]` (delete `word2.charAt(j-1)`) or 
- `[i-1,j-1]` (replace `word1.charAt(i-1)` with `word2.charAt(j-1)`)



```java
class Solution {
    public int minDistance(String word1, String word2) {
        char[] ch1 = word1.toCharArray(), ch2 = word2.toCharArray();
        
        int[][] dp = new int[ch1.length+1][ch2.length+1];
        for(int i = 0; i <= ch1.length; i++){
            dp[i][0] = i;
        }
        for(int i = 0; i <= ch2.length; i++){
            dp[0][i] = i;
        }
        
        for(int i = 0; i < ch1.length; i++){
            for(int j = 0; j < ch2.length; j++){
                if(ch1[i] == ch2[j]){
                    dp[i+1][j+1] = dp[i][j];
                } else {
                    dp[i+1][j+1] = dp[i][j] + 1;
                    dp[i+1][j+1] = Math.min(dp[i+1][j+1], dp[i+1][j] + 1);
                    dp[i+1][j+1] = Math.min(dp[i+1][j+1], dp[i][j+1] + 1);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[ch1.length][ch2.length];
    }
}
```
