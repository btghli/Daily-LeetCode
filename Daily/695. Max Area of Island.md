### 695. Max Area of Island

You are given an m x n binary matrix `grid`. An island is a group of `1`'s (representing land) connected **4-directionally** (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The **area** of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

Return _the maximum **area** of an island in_ `grid`. If there is no island, return `0`.

 

##### Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/01/maxarea1-grid.jpg)
```
Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 6
Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.
```
##### Example 2:
```
Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 0
``` 

##### Constraints:

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 50`
- `grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.

            return 1 + curIsland(grid, i + 1, j) + curIsland(grid, i - 1, j) + curIsland(grid, i, j + 1) + curIsland(grid, i, j - 1);
        }
        return 0;
