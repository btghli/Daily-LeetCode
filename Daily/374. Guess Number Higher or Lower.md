### 374. Guess Number Higher or Lower

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from `1` to `n`. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API `int guess(int num)`, which returns 3 possible results:

- `-1`: The number I picked is lower than your guess (i.e. pick < num).
- `1`: The number I picked is higher than your guess (i.e. pick > num).
- `0`: The number I picked is equal to your guess (i.e. pick == num).
Return _the number that I picked_.

 

##### Example 1:
```
Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6
```
##### Example 2:
```
Input: n = 1, pick = 1
Output: 1
```
##### Example 3:
```
Input: n = 2, pick = 1
Output: 1
```
##### Example 4:
```
Input: n = 2, pick = 2
Output: 2
``` 

##### Constraints:

- 1 <= n <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1
- `1 <= pick <= n`
