### 277. Find the Celebrity

[via: Grandyang](https://www.cnblogs.com/grandyang/p/5310649.html)

Suppose you are at a party with `n` people (labeled from `0` to `n - 1`) and among them, there may exist one **celebrity.**   
The definition of a celebrity is that all the other `n - 1` people know him/her but he/she does not know any of them.  

Now you want to find out _who the celebrity is or verify that there is not one._
The only thing you are allowed to do is to ask questions like: "Hi, A. Do you know B?" to get information of whether A knows B.   
You need to find out the celebrity (or verify there is not one) by asking **as few questions as possible** (in the asymptotic sense).  

You are given a helper function `bool knows(a, b)` which tells you whether A knows B.   
Implement a function `int findCelebrity(n)`.   
There will be exactly one celebrity if he/she is in the party.   
Return _the celebrity's label if there is a celebrity in the party._   
If there is no celebrity, return -1.  

###### Example 1:
```
Input: graph = [
  [1,1,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [1,1,1]
]
Output: 1
Explanation: There are three persons labeled with 0, 1 and 2. graph[i][j] = 1 means person i knows person j, otherwise graph[i][j] = 0 means person i does not know person j. The celebrity is the person labeled as 1 because both 0 and 2 know him but 1 does not know anybody.
```

###### Example 2:
```
Input: graph = [
  [1,0,1],
  [1,1,0],
  [0,1,1]
]
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no celebrity.
```

###### Note:
The directed graph is represented as an adjacency matrix, which is an `n x n` matrix where `a[i][j] = 1` means person `i` knows person `j` while `a[i][j] = 0` means the contrary.  
Remember that you won't have direct access to the adjacency matrix.
