### 1048. Longest String Chain

Given a list of words, each word consists of English lowercase letters.

Let's say `word1` is a predecessor of `word2` if and only if we can add exactly one letter anywhere in `word1` to make it equal to `word2`. For example, `"abc"` is a predecessor of `"abac"`.

A word chain is a sequence of words `[word_1, word_2, ..., word_k]` with `k >= 1`, where `word_1` is a predecessor of `word_2`, `word_2` is a predecessor of `word_3`, and so on.

Return the longest possible length of a word chain with words chosen from the given list of `words`.

 

##### Example 1:
```
Input: words = ["a","b","ba","bca","bda","bdca"]
Output: 4
Explanation: One of the longest word chain is "a","ba","bda","bdca".
```
##### Example 2:
```
Input: words = ["xbc","pcxbcf","xb","cxbc","pcxbc"]
Output: 5
``` 

##### Constraints:

- `1 <= words.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 16`
- `words[i]` only consists of English lowercase letters.

```java
class Solution {
    public int longestStrChain(String[] words) {
        Map<String, Integer> dp = new HashMap<>();
        Arrays.sort(words, (a, b) -> a.length() - b.length());
        int res = 0;
        for (String word : words) {
            int best = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < word.length(); i ++) {
                // loop on all possible previous word with 1 letter missing
                String prev = word.substring(0, i) + word.substring(i + 1);
                best = Math.max(best, dp.getOrDefault(prev, 0) + 1);
            }
            dp.put(word, best);
            res = Math.max(res, best);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
