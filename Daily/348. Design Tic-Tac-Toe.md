### 348. Design Tic-Tac-Toe

Design a Tic-tac-toe game that is played between two players on a `n x n` grid.

You may assume the following rules:

- A move is guaranteed to be valid and is placed on an empty block.
- Once a winning condition is reached, no more moves is allowed.
- A player who succeeds in placing n of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

***

```c
class TicTacToe {
public:
    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    TicTacToe(int n): rows(n), cols(n), N(n), diag(0), rev_diag(0) {}

    int move(int row, int col, int player) {
        int add = player == 1 ? 1 : -1;
        rows[row] += add; 
        cols[col] += add;
        diag += (row == col ? add : 0);
        rev_diag += (row == N - col - 1 ? add : 0);
        return (abs(rows[row]) == N || abs(cols[col]) == N || abs(diag) == N || abs(rev_diag) == N) ? player : 0;
    }

private:
    vector<int> rows, cols;
    int diag, rev_diag, N;
};
```
