### 188. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV

You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.  

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most k transactions.  

Notice that you may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).  

###### Example 1:
```
Input: k = 2, prices = [2,4,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.
```
###### Example 2:
```
Input: k = 2, prices = [3,2,6,5,0,3]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4. Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
```
###### Constraints:
- 0 <= k <= 109
- 0 <= prices.length <= 104
- 0 <= prices[i] <= 1000

class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int k, int[] prices) {
        if(prices == null || prices.length == 0 || k == 0) return 0;
        
        int days = prices.length;
        
        // Handle the corner case with big k value which may cause Memory Limit Exceed
        if(k >= 2 * days) return quickSolve(prices); 
        
        // Moreover, reduce one dimension of days in the dp matrix to save space
        // See Question 123 for the more intuitive solution, which retains the dimension of days
        int[][] dp = new int[k+1][2]; // transactions, status

        for(int d = 0; d < days; d++){
            for(int j = 1; j <= k; j++){

                    dp[j][0] = 0;
                    dp[j][1] = -prices[d];
                    continue;
                }

                dp[j][0] = Math.max(dp[j][0], prev + prices[d]); // dont own the stack
                
            }
        }
        return dp[k][0];
        
    }
    
    // when k is larger than half of the days, we are allowed to obtain all possible profits
    private int quickSolve(int[] prices) {
        int len = prices.length, profit = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < len; i++)
            // as long as there is a price gap, we gain a profit.
            if (prices[i] > prices[i - 1]) profit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1];
        return profit;
    }
