### 187. Repeated DNA Sequences

All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', for example: "ACGAATTCCG".   
When studying DNA, it is sometimes useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.  

Write a function to find all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule.  

###### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"
Output: ["AAAAACCCCC","CCCCCAAAAA"]
```
###### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "AAAAAAAAAAAAA"
Output: ["AAAAAAAAAA"]
```
###### Constraints:
- 0 <= s.length <= 105
- s[i] is 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T'.

```java
class Solution {
    public List<String> findRepeatedDnaSequences(String s) {
        Set seen = new HashSet(), repeated = new HashSet();
        for (int i = 0; i + 9 < s.length(); i++) {
            String ten = s.substring(i, i + 10);
            if (!seen.add(ten))
                repeated.add(ten);
        }
        return new ArrayList(repeated);
    }
}
```

Time Complexity:
O(N) in the loop, where N is s.length().  
The tricky part here is that the [time complexity of s.substring()](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4679746/time-complexity-of-javas-substring) which is 

> O(n) where n is the numbers in the substring

In this case, the numbers in the substring is 10, which is constant. So s.substring() takes O(1) time.
