### 376. Wiggle Subsequence

Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest wiggle sequence.

A wiggle sequence is a sequence where the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with fewer than two elements is trivially a wiggle sequence.

For example, [1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5] is a wiggle sequence because the differences (6, -3, 5, -7, 3) are alternately positive and negative.
In contrast, [1, 4, 7, 2, 5] and [1, 7, 4, 5, 5] are not wiggle sequences, the first because its first two differences are positive and the second because its last difference is zero.
A subsequence is obtained by deleting some elements (eventually, also zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.

 

##### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,7,4,9,2,5]
Output: 6
Explanation: The entire sequence is a wiggle sequence.
```
##### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,17,5,10,13,15,10,5,16,8]
Output: 7
Explanation: There are several subsequences that achieve this length. One is [1,17,10,13,10,16,8].
```
##### Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
Output: 2
```

##### Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 1000

#### DP with 2 Arrays

##### Time Complexity: O(n)
##### Space Complexity: O(n)
```
For every position in the array, there are only three possible statuses for it.

- up position, it means nums[i] > nums[i-1]
- down position, it means nums[i] < nums[i-1]
- equals to position, nums[i] == nums[i-1]

So we can use two arrays up[] and down[] to record the max wiggle sequence length so far at index i.

- If nums[i] > nums[i-1], that means it wiggles up. the element before it must be a down position. 
  so up[i] = down[i-1] + 1; down[i] keeps the same with before.

- If nums[i] < nums[i-1], that means it wiggles down. the element before it must be a up position. 
  so down[i] = up[i-1] + 1; up[i] keeps the same with before.

- If nums[i] == nums[i-1], that means it will not change anything becasue it didn't wiggle at all. 
  so both down[i] and up[i] keep the same.
```
```java
class Solution {
    public int wiggleMaxLength(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length < 2)
            return nums.length;
        int[] up = new int[nums.length];
        int[] down = new int[nums.length];
        up[0] = down[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] > nums[i - 1]) {
                up[i] = down[i - 1] + 1;
                down[i] = down[i - 1];
            } else if (nums[i] < nums[i - 1]) {
                down[i] = up[i - 1] + 1;
                up[i] = up[i - 1];
            } else {
                down[i] = down[i - 1];
                up[i] = up[i - 1];
            }
        }
        return Math.max(down[nums.length - 1], up[nums.length - 1]);
    }
}
```
