### 1663. Smallest String With A Given Numeric Value

The numeric value of a lowercase character is defined as its position (1-indexed) in the alphabet, so the numeric value of a is 1, the numeric value of b is 2, the numeric value of c is 3, and so on.

The numeric value of a string consisting of lowercase characters is defined as the sum of its characters' numeric values. For example, the numeric value of the string "abe" is equal to 1 + 2 + 5 = 8.

You are given two integers n and k. Return the lexicographically smallest string with length equal to n and numeric value equal to k.

Note that a string x is lexicographically smaller than string y if x comes before y in dictionary order, that is, either x is a prefix of y, or if i is the first position such that x[i] != y[i], then x[i] comes before y[i] in alphabetic order.

 

###### Example 1:
```
Input: n = 3, k = 27
Output: "aay"
Explanation: The numeric value of the string is 1 + 1 + 25 = 27, and it is the smallest string with such a value and length equal to 3.
```
###### Example 2:
```
Input: n = 5, k = 73
Output: "aaszz"
```

###### Constraints:

* 1 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup>
* n <= k <= 26 * n

##### Time Complexity: O(n)
##### Space Complexity: O(n)

```java
class Solution {
    public String getSmallestString(int n, int k) {
        char[] c = new char[n];
        Arrays.fill(c, 'a');
        int zCount = (k - n) / 25; // number of z's we need in the string
        if (zCount < n) {
            int beforeZ = (k - n) % 25; // first character before all z's
            c[n - zCount - 1] += beforeZ;
        }
        for (int i = n - zCount; i < n; i ++) {
            c[i] = 'z';
        }
        return String.valueOf(c);
    }
}
```
