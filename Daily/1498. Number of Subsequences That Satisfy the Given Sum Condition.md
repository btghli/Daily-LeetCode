### 1498. Number of Subsequences That Satisfy the Given Sum Condition

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`.  

Return the number of **non-empty** subsequences of `nums` such that the sum of the minimum and maximum element on it is less or equal than `target`.  

Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

###### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [3,5,6,7], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 subsequences that satisfy the condition.
[3] -> Min value + max value <= target (3 + 3 <= 9)
[3,5] -> (3 + 5 <= 9)
[3,5,6] -> (3 + 6 <= 9)
[3,6] -> (3 + 6 <= 9)
```

###### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [3,3,6,8], target = 10
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 6 subsequences that satisfy the condition. (nums can have repeated numbers).
[3] , [3] , [3,3], [3,6] , [3,6] , [3,3,6]
```

###### Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`
- `1 <= target <= 10^6`

> Sort input A first,  
For each A[i], find out the maximum A[j]  
that A[i] + A[j] <= target.  
> 
> For each elements in the subarray A[i+1] ~ A[j],  
we can pick or not pick,  
so there are 2 ^ (j - i) subsequences in total.  
So we can update res = (res + 2 ^ (j - i)) % mod.  
> 
> We don't care the original elements order,  
we only want to know the count of sub sequence.  
So we can sort the original A, and the result won't change.  

##### Java

```java
class Solution {
    public int numSubseq(int[] A, int target) {
        Arrays.sort(A);
        int res = 0, n = A.length, l = 0, r = n - 1, mod = (int)1e9 + 7;
        int[] pows = new int[n];
        pows[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1 ; i < n ; ++i)
            pows[i] = pows[i - 1] * 2 % mod;
        while (l <= r) {
            if (A[l] + A[r] > target) {
                r--;
            } else {
                res = (res + pows[r - l++]) % mod;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }

}
```

##### Python

```python
    def numSubseq(self, A, target):
        A.sort()
        l, r = 0, len(A) - 1
        res = 0
        mod = 10**9 + 7
        while l <= r:
            if A[l] + A[r] > target:
                r -= 1
            else:
                res += pow(2, r - l, mod)
                l += 1
        return res % mod
```
